  <p class="please">You don't need the series of things to happen to you, you just need the series of realization of the abundance around you. Bask in the heat of sweat,kill your throat to the beat of the universal Rhapsody, dance them moves of the Ronaldic synchronisation , smile in the face of mirror and hence reality. Write your mind out,sleep the night in and enjoy the ecstasy , the glimpse and the chunks of touching moments that life serves at your table. You are the watcher , you don’t expect, you watch and review everything a 10 out of 10. Nothing less.</p>

<h2>Pokemon</h2>
<p> Make careful choices with your Stardust. You can’t raise a Pokémon to be strong without stardust. It’s best to save your Stardust for the strategies that help in the long run. But sometimes you just got to raise a perfect IV Bibarel to the max level. Just for the fun of it. This game is about the fun, right? Just the same, you should be transferring your low level Pokémon. Niantic didn’t set up the game to be like the consoles. Most players will end up transferring their starter Pokémon. Once you get to level 30, you’re very likely to find a Pokémon near level 30 that’s better than the one you raised from level 1.</p>

<h2>Running coach</h2>
<p> You know, a day is a memorable one when unexpected things happen in a blissfully coordinated timing and series of thought. One considers it memorable because of the factors like meeting the goal, extraordinary luck, the undeserved feeling , a cohorent realization or a beneficial one. But man! When I look at my life, I feel as if everyday is a day worth memorizing till death.
Every fucking day is a mystery , a kick, a victory. Just that, time is not enough .</p>

<h2>Karate</h2>
<p>  I worked as a bouncer and got into an altercation with someone who ran away to get his friend who had a black belt in karate. When the 'karate' guy came up to me, I bowed and he bowed back. While he was still bowing I kicked him in the face. Not pretty, I know, but I was fighting for real, not interested in fighting 'fair'. Fair is for tournaments.</p>

<h2>Deadly music</h2>
<p> Bohemian Rhapsody," the legendary six-minute single by Queen, is what many call the greatest song ever written. It's still one of the best-selling rock singles of all time, was voted The Song of the Millennium in 2000, and was recorded in the Guinness Book of Records as the No. 1 song of all time.</p>

          <h2> Running long distance</h2>
          <p>The pain in the body makes his mental authority forget about the real motivation behind why he is doing this. ‘Why do runners run?’ might be a curiosity for any normal person. One might wonder why do people even choose this hardship to be their passion? Well, first off, it is the best exercise for cardio. Secondly, there are many levels to conquer and highs to achieve from this. Running can be a good reason to wake up early in the morning if one is looking to shed some weight. </p>

          <h2> National record in blindfold</h2>
          <p>Having a national record tag in something itself is a great thing. And as for me, I have one in the event of Blindfold Cube, solving 9 cubes without looking in an hour time limit. What stays is the fact that I tried and it happened and it will be a mark in the memory for me when I look back and say, well, I tried that thing as well. Because why not to try it all when you only remember it once(Julian, 2006). </p>

          <p>Subconsciously, my body and my mind got aligned to the lifestyle of fitness from that feat. Made me reaize that all the academic excellence I had back then was backed up by countless days of consistent early morning wake up alarms and the hence the cool breeze of the wet fog. Wearing the necessary black and white uniform daily gave me a blast of confidence as people would look at me while I run.Every little kid there looked up to me and said, "malei pani tyo kick sikaunu na dai". </p>

          <p>The jump from 40 to 60 is significant, the jump from 60 to 80 is significant but will take less time to accomplish than the first jump. The jump from 80–100 may happen so slowly as to be almost imperceptible and you may be shocked when you reach it just by doing your normal workload of 40 hours a week. Higher speeds of 80+ may give access to roles in specialised transcription services, programming etc which do require some competence.  </p>
